//Spanning Tree and MST
//Concept mainly applies to undirected weighed graph

// Spanning Tree -> A Tree having N nodes and N-1 edges and all nodes are reachable from each other
// MST ->of all the spanning trees possible for a given graph, the one which has the minimum weights sum called MST

// 1->If each edge has a distinct weight then there will be only one unique MST.
// 2->A complete undirected graph can have n ^(n - 2) number of Spanning Trees
