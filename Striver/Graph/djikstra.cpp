// Can be implemented using set, priority-queue as well as plain BFS
// Priority Queue is the most used approach

// Data Structures used : 
    // Priority Queue
    // Distance Array

// Dijkstra does not work for graphs having single negative wt and graphs having negative weight cycle

// Time Complexity : ElogV
