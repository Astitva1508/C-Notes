Memoization: tend so store the value of subproblems in map (Top - Down)
Tabulation : you go from the base case and build the solution forward

Step1. Identify a DP Problem.( Recursive Problems are generally DP Problems)
Step2. To solve the problem after identification.
   1. Try to represent the given problem in terms of index.
   2. Do all possible operations on that index according to the problem statement.
   3. To count all possible ways - sum of all stuff.
      To find minimum/maximum - Take Minimum/maximum of all stuff.
