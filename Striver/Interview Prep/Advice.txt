Be confident, even if you’re not sure of your answers. The interviewer will test your patience and endurance by making you second guess your answers but don’t let your nerves get the best of you. 

HR will try to put in various challenging situations but your attitude should always be positive and confident. They can see who is being natural, genuine, and who isn’t. Most importantly, ask unique and role-related questions from your interviewer. Even if your coding part didn’t go too well, the interviewer will be impressed by your communication skills. 

Lastly, be honest. Don’t try to lie because the interviewer can catch it. Show genuine interest in the company and the work that they do.
