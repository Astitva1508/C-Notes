    //Important topic for dynamic programming and DSA
    //Implementation of recursion is using stack. Every recusrive call needs address of the first recursive call and the addresses are stored in the stack

    //Where we call the function inside another function changes the flow of code...Mtlb program code likhne ke baad recursive condition call ki ya phle isse bhut farak padta

    //In order to write a recursive code , try to write a function in its own terms...e.g  
    // fact(n) = n * fact(n-1)

    //Time Complexity of Recursive Function calculate karte samay two points:
    // 1. Number of function calls 
    // 2. Complexity of each function
    // Final complexity is the product of 1 and 2
